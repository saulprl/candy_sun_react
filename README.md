# Candy Sun React

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a project I've been sort of replicating over and over on different frameworks for school.
**Candy Sun** is a management app for a small business which used to operate in campus.

## Why on React this time?

I started learning React around August 2022 and I sort of got bored of the course I was taking so I decided to rebuild **Candy Sun** while exploring Material UI.

### Candy Sun versions

- [Candy Sun (the original!)](https://github.com/saulprl/candy-sun-angular), built on Angular (MEAN stack).
- [Candy Sun, the mobile app](https://github.com/saulprl/candy_sun), built on Flutter & Dart.
- [Candy Sun Flutter, as a web app!](https://github.com/saulprl/candy_sun_web). Same as before, but on the web.
